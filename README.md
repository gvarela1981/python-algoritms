# python-algorithms
A list of usefull algoritms to be used as code examples

## Matrix
Usefull algortims for matrix parsing.
- create a dictionary-based Hash table collection from lists-based matrix.
- get all Hashes keys [hash_1, hash_2, hash_n]
- get a list of all values and hashes [[hash_1, value_1, value_2, value_n], [hash_n, value_1, value_n]]
- get a list of all values of a hash table. Output [hash, value_1, value_2, value_n]
- get a list of all values of a hash table accesing it by it's index number. Output [hash, value_1, value_2, value_n]
- get a list of all values at diagonal axis
  1. direction: 'right' or 'left' Default is 'left' Controls de direction of the axis selected
  1. start_col: the number of the column to start the axis. Hashes are considered col=0
  1. start_row: Hash to start the axis
  1. length: Number of column to include in response
